# Welcome to Parallel!

Parallel is an event management platform. Parallel lets you create a geofenced, temporary social network that:

 - Lets you interact with attendees
 - Lets attendees interact with each other
 - Helps attendees navigate your event, geographically and socially!

# Features

Parallel is full-featured. Some of the things it lets you do:

 - Chat! Event-wide and interest-specific
 - User profiles, viewable only by other attendees
 - Event-wide notification system for event managers
 - Customizeable event information, such as floor plans or session schedules
 - So much more...

# Todo

We're a small team of students. Some stuff is broken. Check out our [Waffle.Io] board for specific tasks that need completing. Here are some of the project's loftier goals:

 - A separate management app that lets you set event paramenters
 - Bluetooth Beacons
 - AR navigation
